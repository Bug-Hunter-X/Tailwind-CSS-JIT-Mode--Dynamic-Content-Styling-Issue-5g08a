This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with dynamically generated content.  If the content is added or removed after the initial page load, Tailwind's utility classes might not be applied correctly. This is because Tailwind's JIT mode compiles the CSS based on the initial HTML structure.  Adding or removing elements afterward won't trigger a re-compilation, thus leaving the new elements unstyled. For example, if you add a new `<div>` with `class="bg-blue-500 p-4"`, it might remain unstyled unless you explicitly refresh the page or trigger a re-render that forces Tailwind to re-process the HTML.
